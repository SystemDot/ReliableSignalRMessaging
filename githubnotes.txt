A Signalr and NserviceBus messaging framework that provides secure and reliable push based messaging.

Reliability comes from 

1. Robust hub connection management
2. Hubs backed by msmq queues
3. Auto replay of stuck Hub Messages
4. Throttling of messages when connections are restarted to minimise the need for auto replay
enabled by server side knowledge of remote clients token expiry
5. Client side throttling and msmq persistence
6. message acknowledgments sent back via web api to a separate (non signalr) host.
7. Esent database integration to ensure idempotency.
